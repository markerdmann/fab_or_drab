	Hi Everyone! Welcome to Fab Or Drab, which is now officially 1 day old. This app is designed for people who have trouble making decisions when they're putting
	on clothes (at the store, for example, or before a night on the town). We've put together a small
	demo app for the iPhone that lets you take a picture and upload it (or you can upload via the
	web interface). After the picture has been uploaded, other users can vote "Fab" or "Drab" by 
	clicking on the link which is tweeted out to all your friends. It even includes annotations! :-)
	Users can also find your picture by clicking on the vote link (pictures shown in order of 
	fewest judgments).<br /><br />
	
	You may also notice that you're receiving judgments in spite of the fact that no one else
	knows about this app. We're using CrowdFlower to have paid workers around the world judge your pictures.
	This is a way of seeding the app in order to generate a community of happy and satisfied users. After
	a while, paying for judgments will probably be unnecessary. 
	After a	picture has been judged by workers, the results are posted back to Fab Or Drab and added to the
	stats on the My Pictures page.<br /><br />
	
	Apologies for the rough interface design! Our front-end developers were all busy this weekend. :-)<br /><br />
